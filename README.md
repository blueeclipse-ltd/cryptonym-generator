# cryptonym-generator
This was created by Dan Wilkie (Blue Eclipse Ltd) as an easy way
to generate one off names for projects.

It takes two files - ListA.txt and ListB.txt and picks a random word
for each. It will then write these to UsedNames.txt and delete them from 
the source. It will also display them in the terminal, and wait for the
user to push the return button before it exits.

If you want to keep a record of the original files, copy ListA and ListB
before you start so that it won't overwrite the originals.

## Installation
Simply copy all these files to a location of your choice. As long as they're
all together the program will work.

## Usage
Just execuite Cryptonym_Generator.ps1.
